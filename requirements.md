Project requirements
In the previous project, you added the add book and remove book features directly in your application. Now you will refactor your code to use an external API to facilitate these features.

DONE - Make use of the Bookstore API as your backend.
DONE - Use axios with createAsyncThunk to make your HTTP requests to the backend
    - create id
    - create book
    - delete book
    - get list
DONE - Fetch your books from the Bookstore API after the component has rendered
DONE - Refactor your add book and remove book features to persist your changes in the server
DONE - Your application should behave the same way after the refactoring
